             Define the problem
            This step involves gathering the requirements of the program needed to solve the problem.Questions that should be answered
                <li>What data do we need to proccess?</li>
                <li>How should we process the data?</li>
                <li> What ouput should the program deliver?</li>
                <li>How should the user interface look?</li>

             Design the Program
             Programs design focuses on breaking down the program into smaller, more mangageble components.Various tools are used to help design a program.
               Commonly used tools:
                  <li>Structure Charts</li>
                  <li>Algorithm</li>
                  <li>Flow Chart</li>
                  <li>Decision tables</li>
                  <li>Pseduocode</li>
         </li>
  
         <li style="background-color: lightgreen">
             Code the program
                Once the program has been designed, a developer then writes the code.
                Codeing often involves translating the design from charts and pseducocode into a specific programming language.Usually the language is chosen during the "defining" stage.

             Testing and Debugging
               After code has been written this stage revolves around fixing any bugs in the program.There are two kinds of errors that cause bugs.
                  <li>a.Syntax Errors: These are like grammatical mistakes in the code.</li><li>b.Logical Error:These mistakes might cause an other than intended output but the code still works.</li>
             The programmer must fix these mistakes by carefully exammining the already written code for errors.

             Documentation
               After coding has been completed, the programmer must write a mannual that generally contains the following:
                  <li>An overview of the programs functionality.</li>
                  <li>In-Depth explanations of program features.</li>
                  <li>Documentation of all commands.</li>
                  <li>A thorough description of errors messages generated by the program.</li>
         </li>
          
         <li style="background-color: lightgreen">
         Deploying and Maintaining the Program
             A software team will be responsible for fixing new errors and updating the software with new features.
             When a new feature should be added to the program, the cycle restarts as developers begin to define what problem the new fature will solve.
