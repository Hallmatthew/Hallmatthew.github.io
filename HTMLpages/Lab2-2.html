   <h2>Your Five Business Introduction Rules </h2>

    <p> 1.Stand up: when you are seated and someone approaches you to say "hello" with a handshake, stand up, whether you are a man or woman. By doing so, you show the person you are greeting that they are worth your full attention.</p>
       
   <p>2.Make eye contact: By looking someone directlyy in the eye, you accomplish three things:
    
             1. You will project an image of self-confidence and a healthy self-esteem
             2.You will be preceived as a good listener.
             3.You will probably recieve the same courtesy when you speak.
    
    3.Smile: It sends others a message of acceptance
    4.Say Your Name: If you are meeting someone for the first time you should intoduce yourself using your first and last name.
    5.Shake Hands:Generally speaking, a handshake should last only as long as it takes to greet the person. It should be firm enough to display your sense oof confidence without being a bonecrusher.</p>

<h2>Creating a BAD First Impression</h2>

    <p>Sloppy Language: No matter how well you dress, using sloppy language will lessen your credibillity with others. For example saying yeah instead of yes, or using profanity especially around people that would not find it impressive.Most people consider your choive of words a direct reflection on your intelligence.
    Giggling:While laughter can be the best medicine for many ills, giggling can be annoying.
    Hiding your Hands: Believe it or not, etiquete research has shown that hands above board are more appealing than hands hidden away in pockets. When your hands are not showing, it often sneds a signal to someone that your are not telling all or that you are holding something back.
    Gum Chewing: Let there be no doubt about it, you should not chew gum when meeing people.No exceptions.
    Throat Clearing: The habit of clearing your throat several times during a conversation can be very distracting.</p>
